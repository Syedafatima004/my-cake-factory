  <h1 class="">Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    Cakes & Bakes is the fastest growing retail chain of bakery and confectionary items, owning more than 70 branches scattered over Punjab and with further plans of immense growth in coming time. We are not just committed to provide high quality products to our valued customers; but also to professionally groom the young talent of Pakistan.
  </p>
<h1 class="">Our Journey</h1>
<p>The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".[2]

  The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (plakoeis). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat, heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta", which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.[3]
  
  </p>
  <h1 class=""> Our Variety</h1>
<p>Cakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques. There are about hundreds of different types of cakes, but there are two broad categories, that culinary divide them into: shortened, and unshorted cakes. Unshortened cakes contain no fat while shortened cakes do. These types may be combined in baking.

  Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.[5]
  
  </p>
<h1 class=""> Cooking</h1>
<p>A cake can fail to bake properly, which is called "falling". In a cake that "falls", parts may sink or flatten, because it was baked at a temperature that is too low or too hot,[25][26] when it has been underbaked[26] and when placed in an oven that is too hot at the beginning of the baking process.[27] The use of excessive amounts of sugar, flour, fat or leavening can also cause a cake to fall.[27][28] A cake can also fall when subjected to cool air that enters an oven when the oven door is opened during the cooking process.[29]
